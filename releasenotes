SSHTerm 1.1 (29.1.2020)

- First released version.


SSHTerm 1.2 (9.2.2020)

- Specifying the KEYFILE argument now implies that public key authentication
  should be used instead of any other method (same as in ssh2-handler).

- Now uses an offscreen buffer for text rendering which should speed up anti-
  aliased text rendering on most platforms.

- Increased read and write buffers in main loop from 256 to 1024 bytes.


SSHTerm 1.3 (22.2.2020)

- Now uses AllocBitMap() for allocating the offscreen buffer if
  graphics.library is version 53.6 or older.

- Rewrote the custom malloc memory allocator and fixed a bug in free(), which
  was calling FreePooled() with a too small memory size.

- Fixed password being passed to the keyboard-interactive callback only if it
  was specified in the CLI arguments.

- Now only requests a passphrase for public key authentication if one is
  really needed.

- Increased the i/o buffer size from 1024 to 4096 bytes as it is no longer
  stack allocated.


SSHTerm 1.4 (22.2.2020)

- Added -fno-builtin when compiling src/malloc.c to stop gcc from generating
  a call to calloc() inside of the calloc() function leading to infinite
  recursion when it was used.


SSHTerm 1.5 (8.3.2020)

- Fixed handling of newline characters in the TM_PASTE method.

- Increased the i/o buffer size from 4096 to 32768 bytes for even better
  performance.

- Rewrote the channel reading so that it no longer keeps reading infinitely
  if there is a constant feed of data from the other end. Some libcaca demos
  would trigger this and lock up the terminal so that it could no longer be
  interacted with (thanks to kas1e for testing and reporting this).

- Added palette menu for selecting which of the libtsm ANSI palettes to use
  (the setting can't be saved for now).


SSHTerm 1.6 (13.3.2020)

- Made further to changes to the channel read loop as the previous version's
  changes introduced some new problems. Also the terminal display is now only
  refreshed once at the end of the loop instead of on every iteration.


SSHTerm 1.7 (23.3.2020)

- Added "Clear Scrollback" and "Copy All" operations to the menus.

- Merged in changes from Aetf's libtsm (https://github.com/Aetf/libtsm).

- Added support for ctrl+cursor key, ctrl+home and ctrl+end.

- Added a few more palettes to choose from.

- Implemented the bell control character using IIntuition->DisplayBeep().

- Compiled using AmiSSL 4.4.
