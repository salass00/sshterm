SSHTerm is SSH client with a built in (xterm-256color) terminal emulation
based on an enhanced version of libtsm.

Requirements:

- AmigaOS 4.1 update 6 or newer

- AmiSSL 4.4 (https://github.com/jens-maus/amissl/releases).

Usage:

Run from CLI with commandline template:

HOSTADDR/A,PORT/N/K,USER/A,PASSWORD,NOSSHAGENT/S,KEYFILE/K,MAXSB/N/K

HOSTADDR is the IP address or domain name of the SSH server.

PORT is the port number (defaults to 22).

USER is the user name.

PASSWORD is the login password or key file passphrase depending on the
authentication method used. If this argument is left out a password requester
will be used instead.

NOSSHAGENT stops filesystem from attempting to connect to ssh-agent.

KEYFILE can be used to change the key file used for public key authentication
(defaults to "$HOME/.ssh/id_rsa" or "HOME:.ssh/id_rsa").

MAXSB is the maximum number of lines stored in the scrollback buffer (set to
zero to disable this feature). The default value is 2000 lines.

To connect to SSH server example.org using port 123 and user name "testuser":

SSHTerm example.org PORT 123 testuser

Known issues:

- If the backspace key is not working correctly in the sudo password prompt it
  might be that the remote terminal is set to expect a different sequence for
  erase than ^H which is what libtsm is sending (you can check using
  "stty -a"). If so you can fix this by typing "stty erase ^H" in the client
  terminal.

To Do:

- Implement a configuration GUI so that running from CLI is no longer needed.

- Implement full unicode support using the outline font engine API.
